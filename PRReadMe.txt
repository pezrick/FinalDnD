Project Walkthrough

I started by setting up a Jira board with Epics for each section of the project and stories to complete there using MoSCoW, story points and user stories
I then set up a GitHub repository

I initially tried to write my own python project but then decided to try and do Piers' one as my project proved beyone my skills

I set up a VM on Azure to run the project then connected this to VSC and GitHub to fork the code from Piers' repository

Next, I set up Dockerfiles for ll four sections of the project

I used a YAML file to run these

It was whilst running this for the first time that my VSC code crashed and then I spent half a day trying to get it to reconnect to the VM

This never worked out and as I had not pushed my final changes to Git Hub I ha to recreate my code so I had something to show and created a new repository

Unfortunately, I never got the app running as I ran out of time due to spending too much time on my own code and general IT issues (and being ill for the week we did Docker so having a lot of knowledge to catch up on)

My next steps were to be getting it running with Jenkins then using Docker Swarm to deploy the app
